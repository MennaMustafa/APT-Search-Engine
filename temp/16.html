<h1>Suggest a Site: Instructions</h1>

<p>DMOZ is a web directory of Internet resources.
The directory is hierarchically arranged by subject - from broad to specific.
DMOZ is maintained by community editors who evaluate sites for inclusion in the directory. 
They are our experts, and all submissions are subject to editor evaluation.</p>

<p>We care a great deal about the quality of the directory. We aren't a
search engine and pride ourselves on being highly selective. We don't accept
all sites, so please don't take it personally should a site not be accepted.
Our goal is to make the directory as useful as possible for our users,
not to have the directory include all (or even most) of the sites that
could possibly be listed or serve as a promotional tool for the entities
listed.</p>

<p>To keep DMOZ running smoothly and to assist us in exercising our
editorial discretion, we have set up policies for submitting sites for
our consideration. We may reject, delete, or edit submissions that
violate these policies or that we otherwise believe, in our sole discretion,
should not be included in the directory. We may also reject, delete, or
block other sites that we believe to be associated with a user who has
violated these policies.</p>

<p>Please follow the steps below for each site you would like to suggest.</p>

<h2>Step One</h2>

<p>Search the directory to make sure the site isn't already listed.</p>

<h2>Step Two</h2>

<p>Determine whether the site is appropriate for submission:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not suggest a site that contains only the same (mirror)
or similar content as another listed site.</li>

<li>Do not suggest a site that redirects to another site.</li>

<li>Do not suggest an incomplete site, such as one with broken graphics
or links.</li>

<li>Do not suggest a site consisting largely of affiliate links.</li>

<li>Do not suggest a site with illegal content. Examples of illegal material
include child pornography; libel; material that infringes any intellectual
property right; and material that specifically advocates,
solicits or abets illegal activity (such as fraud or violence).</li>

</ul>

<h2>Step Three</h2>

<p>Submit the site to the single, most relevant, category:</p>

<ul>
<li>For non-English sites, pick the appropriate category under World.</li>
<li>Click the <i class="docsIcon fa fa-clipboard"></i> icon
next to the name of the category you are browsing.
</li>
<li>Carefully follow the instructions on the suggestion form.
</li>
</ul>
Note, a category without the <i class="docsIcon fa fa-clipboard"></i> icon is not accepting suggestions.
In that case, please find a more specific category for the site.
</p>

<h2>After Submitting a Site</h2>

<p>An editor will review your suggestion to determine whether to include
it in the Directory. Depending on factors such as the volume of suggestions
to the particular category, response time can vary dramatically.
Please only suggest a site to the Directory once.
Multiple suggestions of the same or related sites may result in the exclusion
and/or deletion of those and all affiliated sites.</p>

<h3>Updating a Site</h3>

<p>If a site has been accepted for inclusion in the directory but you are
dissatisfied with how the site is described or titled, you may go to the
category where it is listed and flag the listing.
Be polite and civil -- threatening or abusive behavior will not be tolerated.</p>

<h3>Getting Your Site Into Portals and Search Engines Using DMOZ Data</h3>

<p>If your site has been accepted into the Directory, it may take anywhere
from a week to several months for your site to be listed on partner sites
which use the Directory data, such as <a href="http://search.aol.com/">AOL
Search</a>, 
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>,
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Search</a>,
and <a href="/Computers/Internet/Searching/Directories/Open_Directory_Project/Sites_Using_ODP_Data">others</a>.
We make updates of the data available weekly, but each partner has their
own update schedule.</p>

<h3>Editorial Discretion</h3>

<p>Please recognize that making DMOZ a useful resource requires us to exercise
broad editorial discretion in determining the content and structure of
the directory. That discretion extends (but is not limited) to what
sites to include, where in the directory sites are placed, whether and
when to include more than one link to a site, when deep linking is appropriate,
and the content of the title and description of the site. In addition,
a site's placement in the directory is subject to change or deletion at
any time at our sole discretion. You should not rely on any aspect of a
site's inclusion in the directory. Please understand that an editor's
exercise of discretion may not always treat all suggestions equally. You
may not always agree with our choices, but we hope you recognize that we
do our best to make fair and reasonable decisions.</p>

<p><b>The DMOZ team welcomes comments and feedback about the
directory generally. Please let us know what you think, and how we
can improve the service. Thanks!</b></p>
